    <h1>ABOUT MYSELF AND BACKGROUND</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Amadi Mary. I studied medical laboratory science in Abia State University Uturu.</p>
    <p>I did a 1 year internship program which was part of my academic curicullum at ESUTH in 2019</p>
    <p>I have also completed my NYSC program in 2021. </p> 
    <p>I worked with a health facility during my NYSC in 2022 as a scientist.</p>  
    <p>i continued to work with another health facility with same job role .</p>

    <h1>MY EXPECTATIONS IN THE UPSKILL PROGRAM</h1>
    
    <P>I have always been curious and eager to know how a website is been created, how it works, how the links work.</P>
    <p>Everything about website development.</p>
    <p>Joining the upskill program was one of my best decisions. </p>
    <p>I'm hoping that by the end of the program, i will be able to build a full website on my own with ease and understand a lot of things about website development.</p>
    <p>It will also help me know a lot more about tech and hopefully i will explore in it.</p>
